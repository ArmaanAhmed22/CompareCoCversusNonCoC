MissingOutputException in rule generate_diff in line 18 of /home/aa/Desktop/CompareCoCversusNonCoC/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
Output/SEER18-2021/diffs completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
